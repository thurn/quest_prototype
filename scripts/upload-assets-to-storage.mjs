/**
 * Publishes the binary game art (card / dreamcaller / dreamsign / atlas images)
 * to the Firebase Storage bucket that serves it in production.
 *
 * The art is intentionally kept out of git: `scripts/setup-assets.mjs` symlinks
 * it into `public/<dir>/` from the developer's `~/Documents` source folders (and
 * the image cache). The deployed site loads it from the bucket via `assetUrl()`
 * (see `src/runtime/asset-url.ts`) instead of bundling it into the Hosting
 * deploy, so this script keeps the bucket in sync with the local art.
 *
 * Run `npm run setup-assets` first so `public/` is populated, then:
 *   npm run upload-assets
 *
 * Requires the Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) on PATH and an authenticated account
 * with write access to the bucket (`gcloud auth login`). One-time bucket setup
 * (creation, public read, CORS) is documented in
 * docs/quest_prototype/asset-hosting.md.
 *
 * The bucket defaults to the project's Firebase Storage bucket and can be
 * overridden with the ASSET_BUCKET env var; it must match the origin in
 * `.env.production` (VITE_ASSET_BASE_URL).
