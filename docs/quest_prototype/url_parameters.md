# URL Parameters

The quest prototype reads query-string parameters from `window.location.search`
once at page load via `parseRuntimeConfig` in `src/runtime/runtime-config.ts`.
Parameters are not reactive: changing them requires a page reload.

## `seed`

Overrides the battle RNG seed. The value must be a non-negative integer literal
(digits only). Examples of accepted values: `0`, `42`, `12345`.

Rejected (treated as no override):

- Missing or empty (`seed=`)
- Non-integer (`seed=foo`, `seed=1.5`, `seed=1e3`)
- Negative (`seed=-5`)

## `startInBattle`

When set to exactly `1`, the prototype boots directly into a battle instead of
the normal Dreamcaller selection flow. Any other value (including `0`, `true`,
empty, or absent) leaves the normal start flow in place.

## `enableAi`

When set to exactly `1`, the heuristic battle-mode AI takes opponent actions
during battles: the opening enemy turn is drained on mount, and each player
`END_TURN` folds an AI follow-up turn into the same history entry.

For any other value (including `0`, `true`, empty, or absent) the heuristic
opponent is disabled. Battle mode then performs no automatic opponent actions:
the enemy main phase sits idle until the player advances state via the debug
commands (e.g. `PLAY_CARD`, `MOVE_CARD`, `DEBUG_EDIT`, or another `END_TURN`).

The flag is read once at boot and bound onto the cached `BattleInit` for each
session, so toggling it requires a page reload.

## `game`

Parses a Firebase multiplayer room id into `runtimeConfig.gameId`. The value is
normalized to lowercase and must be 4 to 24 lowercase letters or digits after
normalization. Invalid values are treated as an absent room id.

The parsed room id is available to the multiplayer shell.

Example:

```
http://localhost:5173/?game=quest42
```

## Examples

```
http://localhost:5173/                          # default
http://localhost:5173/?seed=42                  # fixed seed
http://localhost:5173/?startInBattle=1          # boot straight into battle
http://localhost:5173/?enableAi=1               # heuristic opponent enabled
http://localhost:5173/?game=quest42             # parsed multiplayer room id
http://localhost:5173/?startInBattle=1&enableAi=1
http://localhost:5173/?seed=7&startInBattle=1
```
