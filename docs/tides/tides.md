# Dreamtides Tides

## Core Idea

A tide is a named gameplay package. It describes a real battle pattern: the kind
of board a deck wants, the resources it converts, the timing it rewards, and the
way it closes games.

Tides are not factions, flavor-only labels, or tiny mechanic tags. A tide exists
when it changes how cards play together on the battlefield. The question is
always what a card is doing in game terms: what board state it creates, what
resource loop it feeds, what timing window it exploits, and what payoff it is
helping a deck reach.

Every tide should have both:

- a narrative identity: what the deck feels like it is trying to do
- a mechanical identity: the concrete game actions and payoffs that define it

## Tide Layers

Dreamtides uses three tide layers.

- Structural tides are full shells. They own the main payoff cards, the central
  engines, and the finishers that define a deck's primary plan.
- Support tides are splashable technique packages. They own setup, smoothing,
  bridges, low-commitment role players, and enablers that reinforce a shell
  without being that shell's main payoff.
- Utility tides are broad role packages. They own generally useful curve,
  interaction, selection, refuel, and closing tools that do one clean job
  without asking for a dedicated density or threshold.

In practice:

- Structural tides own "do the thing, get paid" cards.
- Support tides own "help the deck do the thing more often" cards.
- Utility tides own "this is broadly good regardless of shell" cards.

## Applying Tides To Cards

Apply tides by battlefield function, not by surface wording.

- A card belongs to a structural tide when it is a real payoff, engine, or
  closer for that plan.
- A card belongs to a support tide when it is setup, smoothing, or a bridge that
  another shell can use without needing the full payoff package.
- A card belongs to a utility tide when its job is broadly useful and remains
  clear outside any dedicated shell.
- Mentioning a mechanic is not enough. A card should only carry a tide if it
  actively advances that tide's actual game plan.

Several boundaries matter because they separate similar-looking cards into
different play patterns:

- `materialize_value` owns repeatable ETB and materialized value.
  `materialize_tempo` owns return, temporary banish, replay timing, and pressure
  sequencing.
- `ally_formation` owns true multi-ally scaling and pair-based battlefield
  formation. `ally_wide` owns generic flood plans and non-scaling wide-board
  pressure.
- `character_chain` owns explicit second-character and deploy-chain reward
  cards. `character_curve` owns cheap character density and quantity without
  chain triggers.
- `void_recursion` owns reclaim, replay, and recursive threats. `void_threshold`
  owns count-the-void scaling and threshold finishers.
- `abandon_value` owns abandon as resource conversion and loop fuel.
  `abandon_ladder` owns abandon into upgrade, deck-cheat, and escalation chains.
- `prevent_control` owns reactive denial and payoff for stopping cards.
  `tax_pressure` and `hand_disruption` own proactive taxes and hand attack.
